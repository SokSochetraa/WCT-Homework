    visual presentation of a website, making it visually appealing and responsive across different devices.

2.  Can you explain the CSS box model? 
--> The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that includes margins, borders, padding, and the 
    content itself. Understanding this model is crucial since it affects how elements occupy space on a web page. 
    Example:
             .box {
               width: 200px;
               padding: 10px;
               border: 5px solid black;
               margin: 20px;
             }
              

3.  What is Flexbox, and how does it differ from CSS Grid? 
--> Flexbox is used for one-dimensional layouts (either row or column). CSS Grid is more powerful
    for two-dimensional layouts as it can handle both rows and columns simultaneously.

1.  What is the principle of least privilege? 
--> The principle of least privilege is a security concept that dictates that users and systems
    should only have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions. This reduces 
    the risk of accidental or malicious damage.

2.  What is a firewall and how does it work? 
--> A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing 
    network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted 
    network and an untrusted network, such as the internet.

3.  What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)? 
--> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires more than one method 
    of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity.
    This typically includes something the user knows (password), something the user has (security token),
    and something the user is (biometric verification).
