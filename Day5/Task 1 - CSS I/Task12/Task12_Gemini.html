**Flexbox Layout Model**

Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout Module, is a powerful CSS layout model designed to make it easier to create flexible and responsive layouts. It allows you to arrange items along a single axis (row or column) and distribute space between them.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Flex Container:** The parent element that contains flex items.
* **Flex Item:** The child elements within the flex container.

**Key Properties:**

* **Flex Direction:** Determines the main axis of the flex container.
  - `row`: Items are arranged horizontally.
  - `row-reverse`: Items are arranged horizontally in reverse order.
  - `column`: Items are arranged vertically.
  - `column-reverse`: Items are arranged vertically in reverse order.
* **Justify Content:** Aligns flex items along the main axis.
  - `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container.
  - `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
  - `center`: Items are centered within the container.
  - `space-between`: Items are spaced evenly with space between them.
  - `space-around`: Items are spaced evenly with space around them.
  - `space-evenly`: Items are spaced evenly with equal space between and around them.
* **Align Items:** Aligns flex items along the cross axis.
  - `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container.
  - `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container.
  - `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
  - `center`: Items are centered within the container.
  - `baseline`: Items are aligned to their baseline.

**Responsive Layout Example:**
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Flexbox Responsive Layout</title>
    <style>
      .container {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
      }

      .item {
        flex: 1 1 200px;
        margin: 10px;
        border: 1px solid black;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 20px;
      }

      @media (max-width: 768px) {
        .item {
          flex-basis: 100%;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="item">Item 1</div>
      <div class="item">Item 2</div>
      <div class="item">Item 3</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

**Explanation:**

1. **Flex Container:** The `.container` class sets the display to `flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap` to allow items to wrap to the next line on smaller screens.
2. **Flex Items:** The `.item` class sets the `flex` property to `1 1 200px`, which means:
   - `flex-grow`: 1 - Items can grow to fill available space.
   - `flex-shrink`: 1 - Items can shrink if there's not enough space.
   - `flex-basis`: 200px - Initial size of each item.
3. **Media Query:** The media query targets screens smaller than 768px and sets the `flex-basis` of each item to `100%`, making them take up the full width of the container.

This example demonstrates how Flexbox can create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. By using properties like `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex`, you can achieve a wide range of layouts and design patterns.
