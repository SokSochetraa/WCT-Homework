**Online Fonts**

Online fonts are digital font files that can be accessed and used on websites without the need to download and install them locally. This eliminates the need for users to have specific fonts installed on their devices, ensuring consistent typography across different platforms and browsers.

**Integrating Online Fonts into a Website**

There are several methods to integrate online fonts into a website. One of the most popular methods is using a font service like Google Fonts.

**Using Google Fonts**

1.  **Select Fonts:**
      - Visit the Google Fonts website ([https://fonts.google.com/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://fonts.google.com/)).
      - Choose the desired fonts.
      - Click on the "Select this font" button for each font.
2.  **Customize Fonts:**
      - Adjust font weight, style, and other properties as needed.
3.  **Embed the Font:**
      - Click on the "Embed" button.
      - Copy the provided CSS code.
4.  **Add to HTML:**
      - Paste the copied CSS code into the `<head>` section of your HTML document.

**Example:**

      -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Google Fonts Example</title>
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This text is using the Roboto font.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!--
**Favicons**

A favicon is a small icon associated with a particular website or webpage. It appears in the browser's address bar, tab, and bookmarks. Favicons help users identify websites quickly and easily.

**Adding a Favicon to a Web Page**

1.  **Create a Favicon:**
      - Design a small square image (usually 16x16 pixels) in a suitable format like PNG or ICO.
2.  **Add to HTML:**
      - Place the favicon file in your website's root directory.
      - Add the following code to the `<head>` section of your HTML document:


<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>

Replace `favicon.ico` with the actual filename of your favicon.

By integrating online fonts and favicons, you can enhance the visual appeal and branding of your website, providing a more professional and user-friendly experience.
