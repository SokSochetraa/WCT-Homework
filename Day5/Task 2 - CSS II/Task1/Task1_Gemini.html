**What is a CSS Preprocessor?**

A CSS preprocessor is a programming language extension that adds extra features to standard CSS. These features make writing CSS more efficient, maintainable, and powerful. Preprocessors introduce variables, mixins, functions, loops, and other programming-like constructs into CSS.

**Popular CSS Preprocessors**

Here are some of the most popular CSS preprocessors:

1. **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets):**
   - Offers a clean and concise syntax.
   - Supports variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and more.
   - Example:

   ```css
   // Sass
   $primary-color: #333;

   .button {
     background-color: $primary-color;
     padding: 10px 20px;
     border-radius: 5px;
   }
   ```

2. **Less (Leaner Style Sheets):**
   - Similar to Sass but with a slightly different syntax.
   - Supports variables, mixins, functions, operations, and more.
   - Example:

   ```css
   // Less
   @primary-color: #333;

   .button {
     background-color: @primary-color;
     padding: 10px 20px;
     border-radius: 5px;
   }
   ```

3. **Stylus:**
   - A more expressive and flexible preprocessor.
   - Supports indentation-based syntax, variables, mixins, functions, and more.
   - Example:

   ```css
   // Stylus
   primary-color = #333

   .button
     background-color: primary-color
     padding: 10px 20px
     border-radius: 5px
   ```

**Advantages of Using a CSS Preprocessor:**

- **Improved Maintainability:**
   - Variables and mixins allow for easy customization and code reuse.
   - Nesting helps organize CSS rules and improve readability.
- **Increased Efficiency:**
   - Less repetitive code and faster development time.
- **Enhanced Functionality:**
   - Functions for complex calculations and color manipulations.
   - Loops for generating repetitive CSS patterns.
- **Better Code Organization:**
   - Modular structure for easier management of large CSS files.
- **Advanced Features:**
   - Support for CSS features that are not yet widely supported by browsers.

**How a CSS Preprocessor Simplifies CSS Code:**

Consider the following example of a simple button style:

```css
// Without preprocessor
.button {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: #555;
}
```

Using a preprocessor, we can simplify this code:

```css
// With preprocessor (e.g., Sass)
$primary-color: #333;
$hover-color: #555;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    background-color: $hover-color;
  }
}
```

In this example, we've defined variables for the primary color and hover color. We've also used nesting to style the hover state of the button. This makes the code more concise, readable, and easier to maintain.

By using a CSS preprocessor, you can write more efficient, maintainable, and powerful CSS code, ultimately leading to better-looking and more responsive websites.
