**Theming in CSS**

Theming in CSS is a technique that allows you to change the overall appearance of a website by modifying a set of global styles. This can be achieved by using variables to store color palettes, font families, and other design elements. By changing these variables, you can easily switch between different themes, such as light and dark.

**Implementing Theming with Sass**

Sass is a powerful CSS preprocessor that makes it easy to create themes. By using variables and mixins, you can define global styles that can be easily modified.

**Creating a Simple Theme Switcher**

Here's a basic example of how to create a theme switcher using Sass and HTML:

**Sass Code:**

```scss
// variables.scss
$light-primary: #f0f0f0;
$light-secondary: #333;

$dark-primary: #333;
$dark-secondary: #f0f0f0;

$current-theme: light; // Initial theme

// theme.scss
@if $current-theme == light {
  $primary-color: $light-primary;
  $secondary-color: $light-secondary;
} @else {
  $primary-color: $dark-primary;
  $secondary-color: $dark-secondary;
}

body {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: $secondary-color;
}
```

**HTML Code:**

```html
<button id="theme-toggle">Toggle Theme</button>

<script>
  const themeToggle = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');
  const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';

  document.body.classList.add(currentTheme);

  themeToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const newTheme = currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
    document.body.classList.remove(currentTheme);
    document.body.classList.add(newTheme);
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
  });
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Variables:** We define two sets of color variables: `light` and `dark`.
2. **Conditional Compilation:** Using Sass's `@if` directive, we conditionally assign the appropriate color variables based on the `$current-theme` variable.
3. **Global Styles:** We apply the theme-specific colors to the `body` element.
4. **JavaScript Toggling:** The JavaScript code toggles the `light` and `dark` classes on the `body` element, triggering the theme switch.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Theme Switcher:** You can customize the theme switcher's appearance and behavior to match your website's design.
- **Complex Themes:** For more complex themes, consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass to manage variables, mixins, and functions effectively.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that your themes are accessible to users with visual impairments by providing sufficient color contrast and font sizes.

By using Sass and a well-structured theme system, you can create dynamic and user-friendly websites that adapt to different user preferences and screen sizes.
