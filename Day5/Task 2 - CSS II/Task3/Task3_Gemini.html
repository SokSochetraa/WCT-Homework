**What is Sass?**

Sass, or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, is a CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS by adding features like variables, mixins, nesting, and more. It allows developers to write more organized, efficient, and maintainable CSS code.

**How Sass Differs from Regular CSS**

While regular CSS is a straightforward language for styling web pages, Sass offers several advantages:

1. **Variables:** You can define variables to store reusable values like colors, fonts, and spacing. This makes it easier to maintain consistency and update styles globally.
2. **Nesting:** Sass allows you to nest CSS rules, mirroring the HTML structure. This can improve code readability and organization.
3. **Mixins:** You can create reusable blocks of CSS code, called mixins, to apply multiple properties to multiple selectors.
4. **Partials:** You can split your Sass code into smaller, modular files (partials) and import them into your main Sass file. This helps with organization and code reuse.
5. **Functions:** You can define custom functions to perform calculations or manipulate values, making your code more dynamic.

**Example Sass File**

```scss
// variables.scss
$primary-color: #333;
$secondary-color: #f00;

// button.scss
.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;

  &:hover {
    background-color: $secondary-color;
  }
}

// main.scss
@import "variables";
@import "button";
```

**Compiled CSS**

```css
.button {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: #f00;
}
```

**Notable Differences:**

- **Variables:** Sass variables are replaced with their actual values during compilation, resulting in clean and concise CSS.
- **Nesting:** Sass nesting is flattened into standard CSS selectors, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Partials and Imports:** Sass allows you to organize your code into smaller, reusable files, improving modularity and code reuse.

By using Sass, you can write more efficient, maintainable, and expressive CSS code, ultimately leading to better-looking and more responsive websites.
